# Every team fills in the commands for their own stack.
# The CI pipeline calls these targets, so the names must not change.
#
# Examples:
#   Node    install: npm ci          test: npm test        build: npm run build
#   Python  install: pip install -r requirements.txt
#                                    test: pytest          build: echo "no build step"
#   Java    install: ./mvnw -B dependency:go-offline
#                                    test: ./mvnw test     build: ./mvnw package
